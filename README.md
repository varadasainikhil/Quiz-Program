# Quiz-Program
This is a Quiz propgram built using Python. I have built this program to cement my knowledge of OOP. This is the Day-17 of the 100 Days of Python Programming.
I have taken the questions from the OpenTrivia DataBase manually. There are 50 questions in the program and all are of easy difficulty.
